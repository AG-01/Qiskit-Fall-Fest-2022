## Guidelines

You have a week to learn and explore further and come up with solutions for the challenge.
The organisers will be available to help you learn more and cater to your doubts throughout the week.
There will be an online <b>mid-week session on 19 October 2022, 5:30 PM IST</b>
In the mid week session there will be a special guest speaker to address and guide you in this exciting world of quantum. Also, the team will clear your doubts if any and look at your progress.
You must submit your solutions by <b>21 October 2022,11.59 PM</b> as a PR to this repository.
You must make create a folder by your name in the challenges folder of this repository. You must put your solution in the folder you created and make a <b>PR</b> of the same.
Your solution can be code in jupyter notebook or a document consisting of screen shots of circuits you simulated using IBM quantum platform. In both the cases, good explanation of your solution is a must to get yourself an edge of winning.
A solution will be added by the organisers after the deadline, so you can verify your understanding.

## Challenge

1. Design a quantum circuit that acts as a biased coin. For example: 60% of the time Heads (or 0) shows up and 40% Tails (or 1). You can set any bias you like, just make sure it is not equal. You can assume any missing information.

2. Take a qubit and put it in state of 1. Now create an equal superposition and present the measured result as a histogram. Explain the result obtained.

3. Take 2 qubits and entangle them in as many ways you can think of. Plot a histogram of the results and explain the results. (Hint: maximum ways of entangling 2 qubits is 4)

## Judgement Criteria
approach, originality/uniqueness, explanations at every step
