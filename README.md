## Welcome
This is the Qiskit Fall Fest event for TIET. We're so exciting to have you all here. This event is being hosted by the [DSC TIET](https://dsctiet.tech/#/events).

The [Qiskit Fall Fest](https://medium.com/qiskit/introducing-the-qiskit-fall-fest-feb8456b557) is a collection of quantum computing events on college campuses around the world. Every Fall Fest event is organized and run by the students on each campus, with support from the entire IBM Quantum team. Student leaders work alongside IBM throughout the month of September to design and plan their event, which are then run in October. The events vary from technical hackathons to beginner-friendly challenges, all with the goal of helping to grow the local communityâ€™s skill set.

The Fall Fest here on TIET is going to be a workshop and challenge, starting on October 15th 2022. Details about the event and rules can be found below. The deadline for all projects is October 24th, at 1pm ET. Any projects submitted after that will NOT be judged. Good luck!
